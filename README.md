# ProSoH: Professional Battery State of Health (SoH) Predictor üîã

This repository contains a complete, end-to-end system for predicting the State of Health (SoH) of Lithium-ion batteries. The project features a highly accurate XGBoost machine learning model (R¬≤ > 0.997) wrapped in a user-friendly Streamlit web application.

The application allows non-technical users to get instant SoH predictions by simply uploading a raw data log from a battery cycler, making advanced data science accessible to a wider audience.
