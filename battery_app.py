    To use this tool, you need a specific type of data file. Here's how to get your prediction:

    **1. Obtain Your Data Log:**
       - You must have a system that can record your battery's `Voltage (V)` and `Current (A)` over at least one full charge-and-discharge cycle.
       - This is typically done with a battery cycler, a data logger, or a custom sensor setup.

    **2. Format Your Data as a CSV File:**
       - Save the data log as a Comma-Separated Values (`.csv`) file.
       - **Crucially**, your file must contain the following columns with these exact names:
         - `Cycle_Index`: The number of the cycle (e.g., 1, 2, 50, 150).
         - `Voltage (V)`: The battery's voltage at a point in time.
         - `Current (A)`: The battery's current at a point in time (positive for charge, negative for discharge).

    **3. Use the Predictor:**
       - Go to the **ðŸ“Š Predictor** tab.
       - Click the "Browse files" button and upload your CSV file.
       - Once uploaded, select the specific `Cycle_Index` you wish to analyze from the dropdown menu.
       - Click the **âš¡ Run Prediction** button. Your results will appear instantly.
